# Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset

Welcome to my Data Scientist Role Play project, where I've taken on the role of a data scientist to dive into the intriguing world of the Yelp dataset. In this project, I've had the chance to explore, analyze, and uncover insights from a real-world dataset â€“ just like a data scientist would in the field.

## Project Overview

The project is structured into two fascinating parts, each offering a unique perspective on data analysis:

### Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

In this phase, I embarked on a journey to profile the Yelp dataset by formulating specific questions and crafting SQL queries to extract key information. By delving into record counts, statistical values, and patterns within the dataset, I gained a deep understanding of its structure and content. This phase mirrored the initial steps I would take when encountering new data, setting the foundation for more advanced analysis.

### Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

The second part allowed me to put my analytical skills to the test. I formulated my own question for analysis and designed a tailored dataset to address it. My chosen path led me to explore sentiment analysis, where I parsed review texts, categorized sentiments, and correlated them with business categories and star ratings. This segment showcased my ability to apply data-driven thinking to derive meaningful insights and conclusions from the data.

## My Approach

Throughout the project, I had the opportunity to:

- Strengthen my SQL skills by crafting queries to profile and extract relevant insights from the dataset.
- Develop a hands-on understanding of data analysis by framing and answering questions that explored various aspects of the data.
- Apply critical thinking and problem-solving abilities to interpret findings and draw conclusions.
- Contextualize my analysis by considering factors such as sentiment, ratings, and business categories.

## Key Takeaways

By completing this project, I not only honed my technical abilities but also embraced the essence of a data scientist's role. Profiling data, asking meaningful questions, and translating insights into actionable conclusions are essential skills that define the data science journey. The project provided a platform to apply theory into practice and solidify my understanding of data analysis methodologies.

Feel free to explore the SQL queries, analysis, and insights that I've curated. This project encapsulates my experience as a data scientist and underscores the invaluable role that data analysis plays in making informed decisions. Let's dive in and explore the world of data together!
